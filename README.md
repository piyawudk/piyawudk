Hi, Iâ€™m Piyawud, although you can call me Micro. 
I'm a Robotics and AI Engineering students, holding a second degree on Smart Materials Technology which focuses on how to improve the robot.
I'm really interested in AI and Machine Learning stuff, as well as robotics (the coding part).
I'm not very strong at coding yet, but I always try my best!
